            <h2>What is Twitch and What are VTubers?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Twitch</strong> is a live streaming platform where content creators, especially gamers and artists,
              engage with their audiences in real time through video and chat. Streamers often personalize their channels with custom visuals to stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>VTubers</strong>, or Virtual YouTubers, are content creators who use animated avatars to represent themselves onlineâ€”
              often brought to life with motion tracking software. These avatars can be 2D or 3D and are often designed by talented artists like Gaiya.
