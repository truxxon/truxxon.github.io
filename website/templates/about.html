                Hey there! Iâ€™m Zoeyâ€”a digital artist and Twitch streamer who specializes in bringing unique visions to life through commission work. Whether itâ€™s character designs, illustrations, or custom pieces, I love creating art that resonates with people and captures their ideas in a way that feels personal and meaningful. On stream, I share my process, offer tips, and give a behind-the-scenes look at the world of digital commissions. Art isnâ€™t just my passionâ€”itâ€™s my way of making something special for others. Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
