                Hey there! I’m Zoey—a digital artist and Twitch streamer who specializes in bringing unique visions to life through commission work. Whether it’s character designs, illustrations, or custom pieces, I love creating art that resonates with people and captures their ideas in a way that feels personal and meaningful. On stream, I share my process, offer tips, and give a behind-the-scenes look at the world of digital commissions. Art isn’t just my passion—it’s my way of making something special for others. Let’s create something amazing together!
